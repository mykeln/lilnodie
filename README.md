A starting point for a basic NodeJS app that uses TailwindCSS and FlowbiteCSS for easy styling.

1. A semi-working mind + a working Mac (or Linux) machine.

## Setup
1. Run `setup.sh`
- Give your app any name you'd like.
- Fill in subjective things where appropriate, but otherwise leave default values.
2. Duplicate the `env_example` file as `.env`, adding any relevant credentials needed for your app.

## Usage
1. Run `npm run start` to run the app

## Updating
1. Run `npm run build-css` after any HTML changes to generate any newly-defined tailwind/flowbite styles.
